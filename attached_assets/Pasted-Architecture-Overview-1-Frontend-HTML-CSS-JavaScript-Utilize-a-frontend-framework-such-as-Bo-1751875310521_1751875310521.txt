Architecture Overview
1. Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Utilize a frontend framework such as Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, or custom CSS for responsive design.
Use libraries like jQuery or Vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation and event handling.
Optionally, integrate a frontend framework (React, Vue, or Angular) if you want a more dynamic application.
2. Backend: Python (Flask/FastAPI)

Use Flask or FastAPI to create a RESTful API where the frontend can send requests and receive responses.
Handle data processing, analysis, and statistical calculations using Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Scikit-learn.
Structure your API endpoints to correspond to application functionalities.
3. Visualization: Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Use Plotly for interactive plots that can be embedded into your frontend.
Seaborn and Matplotlib can be used to generate static visualizations that can be returned as images.
Ensure proper integration of visualization outputs with the frontend for effective display.
ðŸ§© Detailed Feature Breakdown
1. File Upload and Parsing
Frontend:
Create a file upload form using HTML <input type="file">.
Use JavaScript to handle file uploads and send the file to the backend.
Backend:
Create an endpoint to handle file uploads, parse them with Pandas, and return a preview of the dataset.
Implement logic to display the first and last 10 rows alongside a summary of missing values.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Frontend:
Build a UI to trigger the EDA analysis via a button click.
Backend:
Define an endpoint that performs EDA calculations (data types, null counts, statistics, etc.).
Use Pandas and seaborn/matplotlib for generating correlation matrices and principal statistics.
Return results in a JSON format to the frontend.
3. Visualizations
Frontend:
Use Plotly.js to display visualizations returned from the backend.
Create various templates to present different kinds of charts dynamically (histograms, boxplots, etc.).
Backend:
Define endpoints that generate and return visualizations as images or JSON objects.
4. Column-wise Detailed Analysis
Frontend:
Create UI elements that allow users to select columns for analysis.
Backend:
Implement analysis functions for univariate and bivariate analysis.
Return details about missing values, outliers, and test results for user-selected columns in a structured format.
5. Statistical Tests Module
Frontend:
Provide options for users to select statistical tests.
Backend:
Implement the logic to conduct selected tests (T-test, ANOVA, Chi-square, etc.) and return results, including p-values and interpretations.
6. Column-wise Feature Engineering
Frontend:
Allow users to specify and select transformations for columns.
Backend:
Provide endpoints for each feature engineering technique (e.g., scaling, encoding) and return the results.
7. Column Comparison Engine
Frontend:
UI to facilitate the selection of multiple columns for comparison.
Backend:
Calculate and return statistical comparisons (correlation coefficients, test results) along with suggested visualizations.
8. Recommendations and Insights
Frontend:
Display AI-generated recommendations in a readable format after each major analysis.
Backend:
Implement logic to derive insights from previous analyses and user-selected criteria.
9. Advanced Configuration
Frontend:
Add options for users to select configurations, like choosing target columns or custom parameters for tests.
Backend:
Handle user-defined configurations in the analysis function.
10. Deployment and Output
Frontend:
Provide a download button for the entire analysis report as HTML or PDF.
Backend:
Generate reports using libraries like WeasyPrint or ReportLab for PDFs.
ðŸ“‹ Final Deliverables
Source Code: Modular, well-documented codebase with clear separation between frontend and backend functionalities.
API Documentation: Use OpenAPI (Swagger) annotations to document your API endpoints.
User Manuals: Guide users on how to upload datasets, configure analyses, and interpret results.
Deployment Guides: Instructions on deploying the application to platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Docker.
ðŸš€ Example Use Case Flow
User accesses the web application and is greeted with a file upload section.
User uploads a CSV file, sees a preview, and checks data quality metrics.
They select variables to analyze and initiate the EDA process through a button.
Users receive a comprehensive EDA report with visualizations and summaries.
Recommendations are suggested based on analysis findings.
User can download their entire analysis report as well as view interactive visualizations hosted on the page.
