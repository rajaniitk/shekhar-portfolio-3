## üîç Prompt: Build an Intelligent EDA + Feature Engineering Web App
I want to build a _comprehensive AI-powered web application_ for _automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),_ _statistical testing,_ **_feature engineering, and_** _column-wise analysis_, which should work with multiple dataset formats. The app should take a dataset (uploaded by the user in formats like .csv, .xlsx, .json, or .parquet) and output _detailed visual and textual analysis_, insights, and statistical recommendations. Here's the complete scope of the application.
* * *
### üß© Functionality Overview:
#### üìÅ 1. File Upload and Parsing:
*   Allow users to upload datasets in multiple formats:
    
    *   .csv
        
    *   .json
        
    *   .xlsx
        
    *   .parquet
        
*   Automatically detect file format and parse it correctly using pandas or suitable parsers.
    
*   Show a preview (e.g., first 10 and last 10 rows) of the dataset after loading.
    
*   Option to drop rows, handle missing values (drop/impute), and encode special characters in headers.
    
* * *
#### üß™ 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
*   _Global EDA Report (overview):_
    
    *   Shape of the dataset
        
    *   Data types of columns
        
    *   Null value summary
        
    *   Unique values
        
    *   Duplicate row count
        
    *   Memory usage
        
    *   Basic statistics (mean, median, mode, std, min, max, etc.)
        
    *   Skewness and kurtosis
        
    *   Correlation matrix (Pearson, Spearman)
        
    *   Pairplot and heatmap
        
*   Option to export this EDA as a PDF/HTML report
    
* * *
#### üìä 3. Visualizations:
For each column (individually and pairwise), generate appropriate visualizations:
*   For numerical columns:
    
    *   Histogram
        
    *   Boxplot
        
    *   KDE plot
        
    *   QQ plot

    *   Boxplot split by category
        
    *   Violin plots
        
    *   Swarmplots

#### üìê 4. Column-wise Detailed Analysis:
Let the user _select one or more columns_ to explore in depth. For the selected column(s), the app should perform:
*   _Univariate Analysis:_
    
    *   Summary statistics
        
    *   Missing value percentage
        
    *   Outlier detection using IQR/Z-score

*   _Bivariate Analysis:_
    
    *   Comparison with target (if specified)
        
    *   ANOVA / t-test if categorical vs numeric
        
    *   Chi-square test for categorical vs categorical
        
    *   Correlation test for numeric vs numeric
        
*   _Multivariate Analysis:_
    
    *   VIF scores
        
    *   PCA visualizations
        
    *   Feature interaction heatmap
        
_Give_ natural language interpretation* of test results (e.g., "p-value < 0.05 suggests significant difference").
* * *
#### üß™ 5. Statistical Tests Module:
For selected column(s), run _relevant statistical tests_:
*   T-test (one-sample, two-sample, paired)
    
*   ANOVA (one-way, two-way)

*   Levene's/Bartlett's test for equal variance
    
*   Mann‚ÄìWhitney U / Kruskal-Wallis (for non-parametric)
    
*   Display:
    
    *   Null hypothesis
        
    *   Test statistic
        
    *   p-value
        
    *   Interpretation in plain English

    *   One-hot encoding
        
    *   Label encoding
        
    *   Frequency/target encoding
        
    *   Group rare categories
        
*   For date/time:
    
    *   Extract year, month, day, weekday
        
    *   Cyclical encoding (sine/cosine for time)
        
*   For text columns:

    *   Embedding suggestions
        
Each transformation should include:
*   Before/after visual

*   Option to revert
    
* * *
#### üß† 7. Column Comparison Engine:
